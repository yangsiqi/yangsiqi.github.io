<h2>Justin Bieber's 'Purpose'</h2>

<p>Purpose is the fourth studio album by Canadian singer Justin Bieber, released on November 13, 2015, by Def Jam Recordings. The album was preceded by the release of the worldwide number one lead single "What Do You Mean?" (released on August 28, 2015),and the record-breaking second single "Sorry" (released on October 21, 2015). The third single "Love Yourself" was also a success,reaching number one in the UK and New Zealand and the top ten in Australia and the United States.</p>

<h2>25</h2>
<p>Titled as a reflection of her life and frame of mind at 25 years old, 25 is a "make-up record". The album's lyrical content features themes of Adele yearning for her old self, her nostalgia, and melancholy about the passage of time as well as themes of motherhood and regret. In contrast to Adele's previous work, the production of 25 incorporated the use of electronic elements and creative rhythmic patterns, with elements of 1980s R&B and organs. Like 21, Adele collaborated with producer and songwriter Paul Epworth and Ryan Tedder, along with new collaborations with Max Martin and Shellback, Greg Kurstin, Danger Mouse, the Smeezingtons, Samuel Dixon, and Tobias Jesso Jr.</p>
<p>As earlier reported, Adele’s 25 album makes a truly historic debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart. The set -- released on Nov. 20 through XL/Columbia Records -- earned 3.48 million equivalent album units in the week ending Nov. 26, according to Nielsen Music. Of that figure, 3.38 million were in pure album sales ­-- the single largest sales week for an album since Nielsen began tracking point-of-sale music purchases in 1991.
The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week based on multi-metric consumption, which includes traditional album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). The new Dec. 12-dated chart (where Adele is No. 1) will be posted in full to Billboard’s websites on Tuesday, Dec. 1.
Adele's '25' Official First Week U.S. Sales: 3.38 Million
It almost goes without saying that 25’s equivalent album unit figure of 3.48 million is also the largest registered since the chart began tracking weekly popularity based on overall units in December of 2014. (A week ago, Justin Bieber set the former record of 649,000 units, when his Purpose album debuted at No. 1.)
25’s overall equivalent unit figure is comprised mostly of pure album sales, along with 96,000 in track equivalent album units, and another 8,000 in streaming equivalent album units. (All of 25’s streaming units come from streams of the single “Hello,” as it is the only song from the album available on streaming services.)
25 is Adele’s second No. 1 album, and follows the chart-topping 21, which returns to the top 10 for the first time in nearly two-and-a-half years, and to its highest rank in over three. It climbs 25-9 with 46,000 units (up 125 percent) and 34,000 in pure album sales (up 163 percent). 21 was last in the top 10 on the March 16, 2013-dated list, when it ranked at No. 10. It last ranked at No. 9 on the Nov. 3, 2012 chart.
